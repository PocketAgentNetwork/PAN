# 🚨 Risk Assessment & Stability Analysis
**Date:** 2026-02-14
**Version:** v1.0 (Alpha)
**Status:** 🔴 CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED

## Risk Register (1-7)

### 1. 💥 The "Event Loop Blocker"
**Status:** ✅ **FIXED** (2026-02-14)
**Severity:** Critical
**Description:** Broadcasting to large rooms (>1k users) happens synchronously on the main thread.
**Consequence:** The server freezes for several seconds during large broadcasts. No new connections, pings, or auths are processed.
**Fix:** Implemented async `setImmediate` chunking for broadcasts. Large messages are now processed in batches of 50.

### 2. 🧟 The "Zombie" Connection Leak
**Status:** 🔴 **OPEN**
**Severity:** High
**Description:** Server does not aggressively prune dead connections (e.g. WiFi drops, client crashes).
**Consequence:** Memory usage grows indefinitely with "ghost" users. Broadcasts waste CPU on dead sockets.
**Fix:** Implement server-side Heartbeat (Ping/Pong) interval. Disconnect if no Pong after 30s.

### 3. 💣 The Memory Bomb (Heap Limit)
**Status:** 🔴 **OPEN**
**Severity:** High
**Description:** All state (`agents` Map, `rooms` Map) is in-memory.
**Consequence:** ~50k concurrent users will hit Node.js default 2GB heap limit, triggering GC thrashing and eventually crashing the process.
**Fix:** Use Redis for session storage and run multiple Node processes.

### 4. 🔑 "Trust Me Bro" Auth
**Status:** 🔴 **OPEN**
**Severity:** High
**Description:** Authentication relies on a static shared secret (`owl-secret-2026`) and self-reported `agentId`.
**Consequence:** Impersonation (anyone with the key can be "admin") and Replay Attacks.
**Fix:** Implement Public/Private Key Auth (Challenge-Response).

### 5. 🏚️ Single Point of Failure (SPOF)
**Status:** 🔴 **OPEN**
**Severity:** Critical
**Description:** The entire network lives in one `server.ts` process.
**Consequence:** One bug or crash takes down the entire network. Zero redundancy.
**Fix:** Horizontal scaling with shared state (Redis) + Process Manager (PM2).

### 6. 🧠 Amnesiac Server (No Persistence)
**Status:** 🔴 **OPEN**
**Severity:** Medium
**Description:** No database.
**Consequence:** Server restart wipes all room history, user profiles, and relationships.
**Fix:** Integrate Postgres/SQLite for persistent data (Users, Room Configs).

### 7. 🕵️ No Encryption (Man-in-the-Middle)
**Status:** 🔴 **OPEN**
**Severity:** Medium
**Description:** WebSocket traffic is plain text if not using `wss://`.
**Consequence:** Eavesdropping on chat and auth tokens.
**Fix:** Enforce TLS (SSL) in production (Nginx/Cloudflare).

### 8. 🏟️ Supergroup Capacity (The N² Problem)
**Status:** 🔴 **OPEN**
**Severity:** Medium
**Description:** A single room with >2,000 active agents creates exponential message load.
**Consequence:** If 100 agents in a 2,000-person room speak at once, the server must process 200,000 messages instantly. This causes latency spikes even with chunking.
**Fix:** Shard large rooms or implement "Slow Mode" / "Message Sampling" (only send to a subset of users).
